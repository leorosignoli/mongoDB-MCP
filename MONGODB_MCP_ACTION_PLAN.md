# MongoDB MCP Server Action Plan

## Phase 1: Setup & Architecture (Week 1)

### Initialize TypeScript project (faster execution than pure JS)
- Set up TypeScript with strict mode
- Configure ESLint and Prettier
- Initialize package.json with MCP SDK dependencies

### Design MCP tool structure:
- **query** - Execute MongoDB queries
- **aggregate** - Run aggregation pipelines
- **listCollections** - Show all collections
- **listDatabases** - Show all databases
- **getIndexes** - View collection indexes
- **explain** - Query performance analysis
- **stats** - Collection/database statistics

### Create Docker base:
- Node.js Alpine image
- Multi-stage build for smaller size
- Environment variable support

## Phase 2: Core Implementation (Week 2)

### Implement MongoDB connection:
- Connection string parser
- Connection pooling
- Error handling and retry logic

### Build safety layer:
- Command sanitization
- Blacklist delete operations (drop, remove, deleteOne, deleteMany)
- Read-only operations validator

### Develop MCP tools:
- Implement each tool with proper schemas
- Add response formatting
- Include error messages

## Phase 3: Enhanced Features & Optimization (Week 3)

### Advanced MongoDB Driver Features:
- Advanced query builders and helper functions
- Transaction support for read operations
- Connection monitoring and health checks
- Comprehensive logging and debugging tools

### Performance & Reliability:
- Query result caching
- Connection pool optimization
- Request rate limiting
- Performance metrics and monitoring

### Enhanced Safety & Validation:
- Advanced query pattern analysis
- Resource usage monitoring
- Timeout management
- Detailed audit logging

## Phase 4: Testing & Deployment (Week 4)

### Comprehensive Testing Suite:
- Unit tests for each tool and component
- Integration tests with test MongoDB instances
- Security testing for injection attempts and edge cases
- Performance testing under load
- End-to-end testing with real MCP clients

### Production Deployment:
- Health check endpoints and monitoring
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Environment-specific configurations
- Docker optimization and security hardening
- Kubernetes deployment manifests

### Documentation & Examples:
- Complete README with setup instructions
- API documentation with examples
- Configuration guides for different environments
- Troubleshooting guides
- Example client integrations

## Updated Deliverables:
- Production-ready TypeScript MCP server with enhanced MongoDB tools
- Optimized Docker container with health checks and monitoring
- Comprehensive safety layer with advanced validation
- Complete documentation suite for all user types
- Performance monitoring and debugging capabilities
- Example configurations for development, staging, and production
